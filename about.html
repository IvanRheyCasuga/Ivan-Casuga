          <p>
            We the FindThatSpot, we travel around the Philippines and explore the hidden places which is wonderful enough to let the people visit the place. As we travel and find some amusing place, we let people know that place and let people explore what's in the place which is very enjoying and relaxing. We found that there's more hidden places that it's not yet explored. Our life is Our Picture, we promote beautiful places for everyone and their enjoyment.
